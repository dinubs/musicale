# Musicale Code

This is the backend/frontend code to musicale.herokuapp.com It runs off my HM stack, although it would just be H as there is no MongoDB incorporated currently.

Read about the HM stack here  --> https://github.com/gavindinubilo/hm-generator

The music is coming from labs.echonest.com you can view the code in controllers/api_controller.js

The frontend is powered w/ React.js style is w/ SCSS, you can view the code for this in uncompiled/js and uncompiled/scss. It uses a fetch polyfill for requesting resources from the server.
